TO MAKE A NEW BRANCH

RUN THE UPDATE SCRIPT cd into CLEANUP and: 
node . --path="../../ADM/ADM Sustainability Internal/design_proof" --endpoint=live --email=sadmin@mpemail.com --password=Song2!2Montage?2Skirmish

REMINDER: This copies all the stuff into shipping code

git init
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://bitbucket.org/Allen_Interactions/3m_quality_essentials.git
(my own repo is https://github.com/BThvedt/3m_quality_commercialization.git - I only use "main" for this)
(MIGHT NEED: git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories)
git push --set-upstream origin master
 
MAKE A NEW BRANCH
git branch alpha (or beta or gold)
git checkout alpha

(run the cleanup script)

git status
git add .
git commit -m "Alpha Build"
git push --set-upstream origin alpha

Then create pull request
Do not check "delete alpha" (or branch)
CONFLICTS? 
https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/resolve-merge-conflicts/ (git pull origin master into beta or whatever)
https://linuxpip.org/git-accept-all-incoming-changes/ (git checout --ours .)
Merge 

And that is the bitbucket workflow 

STILL CANT MERGE?
Just switch branch to master, run cleanup script then push that
"git push origin master -f" (the force is to force an update)

Remember - it has to be a "Company Managed" project (only admins can create)
Then find project settings on the top bar
Choose "Issue Collector" from the side bar that pops up
Create an Issue Collector
Replace script in the jiraWindow.html file
