00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
At ADM, we define sustainable

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,700
agriculture as good stewardship of the

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,900
natural systems and resources that

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,800
farmers rely on for crop production. 

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,500
The objective of our sustainable agriculture efforts

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,700
is to help our supply chain meet society's commodity needs

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,800
without compromising our future ability to produce.
