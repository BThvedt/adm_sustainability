Scope 3 emissions include all sources not within ADM’s scope 1 and 2 boundary.</p><p>The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines 15 categories of scope 3 emissions, though not every category is relevant to ADM. In fact, there are three key categories that ADM can control and have the largest impact. You’ll learn more in this lesson.</p>",
