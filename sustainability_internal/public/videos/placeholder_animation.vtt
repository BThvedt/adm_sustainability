00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
At ADM, we define sustainable

00:02.400 --> 00:04.700
agriculture as good stewardship of the

00:04.700 --> 00:06.900
natural systems and resources that

00:06.900 --> 00:09.800
farmers rely on for crop production. 

00:09.800 --> 00:11.500
The objective of our sustainable agriculture efforts

00:11.500 --> 00:14.700
is to help our supply chain meet society's commodity needs

00:14.700 --> 00:19.800
without compromising our future ability to produce.
