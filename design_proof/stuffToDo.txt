1) Eliminate extra pages, components. Start with menu page, section A (2 pages), section B (2 pages), conclusiuon
2) Eliminate the Json features I don't really use
3) Add in the Extra Json for stuff like menu .. (and eventually glossary)
3) Eliminate data folder
4) Eliminate extra environent variables
5) Make sure LMS functionality works
6) Navagatble, non-navitagble pages 
7) Modal component 
8) Components List: 
	- Modal 
	- popup
	- prompt
	- multi choice
	- multi select
	- drag/drop into plabes
	- drag/drop into columns
	- slider/rotator
	- glossary
	- continue where left off modal (as an example of how to use the modal base if nothing else)
	- innerCourseLink
	- tabs
	- accordian
	


Possible next steps: 
add extra json files
edit meta and store to not use objectives .. unnedded
menu and conclusion pages bare minimum functionality 
remind myself about the load extra json path function 
goal for tonight .. ENV var refactor? LMS test? Module Portal test??? Who knows ... 

Next: make Glossary modal (glossary button in header)

Eh .. I should figure out tabs first before 

Ok. SO! Goal tomorrow.. do tabs component, conclusion screen. Test locally, test live, test LMS.
Then do taxes. Haha

HOW TO COMBINE COMPONENTS ---- --- --- for this version.. just do w/ code
- click/reveal accordian
- popup/question 

Display
- basic - containers & sections
- custom (custome controls for modified components)
- grouped (for combining components)

Things I want to do tomorrow -- 
- Finish Conclusion
- test in LMS and in Module Portal 
- Make editable
- Load JSON for pages 
- Think of plan to switch active back and forth (Users can't see active, admins get special css class)
